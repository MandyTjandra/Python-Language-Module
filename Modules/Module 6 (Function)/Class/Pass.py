class Example:
    pass  # Placeholder for a class body

def function():
    pass  # Placeholder for a function body

# The pass statement in Python is a placeholder that does 
# nothing when executed. It is used when a block of code is 
# syntactically required but you don't want to execute any 
# statement at that point.

# You can use pass to while sketching your code, for example:
# 'if condition:
    # pass                         # Logic to be added later
# else:
    # print("Condition is false.")'
